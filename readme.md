### **Messages**

Messages represent the interaction between the user and the AI, typically in a structured way. They include the user's questions or commands, the AI's responses, and sometimes system instructions to guide the AI's behavior. These messages form the context for a conversation, helping the AI understand what to generate next.

### **Model**

A model is the specific version of the AI being used, like a tool that determines the quality and capabilities of the responses. Different models have different strengths, such as being faster, more advanced, or more cost-effective. Choosing a model depends on the complexity of the task.

### **Max Completion Tokens**

This parameter defines the maximum length of the AI’s response in terms of tokens (small units of text like words or characters). It ensures that the response doesn’t exceed a certain size, which is useful for controlling the output’s length based on your needs.

### **n**

This refers to how many responses the AI generates for a single input. If you want multiple variations of an answer to compare or choose from, increasing this number will give you more options. It’s helpful for brainstorming or exploring different possibilities.

### **Stream**

When enabled, this allows the AI to send its response gradually, like typing in real time, instead of delivering it all at once. It creates a smoother, more natural experience, especially in conversational interfaces or interactive applications.

### **Temperature**

Temperature controls how creative or focused the AI's responses are. A lower temperature makes the output more predictable and precise, while a higher temperature leads to more varied and imaginative responses. It’s like adjusting the level of creativity.

### **Top_p**

Top_p is another way to control the randomness of responses, but instead of randomness, it focuses on the likelihood of certain words being used. By narrowing or expanding the range of possible words, it balances diversity and relevance in the output.

### **Tools**

Tools are external functionalities or integrations that the AI can use to perform tasks beyond just responding with text. For example, it might generate images, execute code, or fetch information from the web. These tools extend the AI's capabilities for more specialized tasks.
