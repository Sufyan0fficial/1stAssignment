API:
An API is like a bridge that helps two programs talk to each other, so one can use the other's features without knowing all its details.

SDK:
An SDK is a toolkit with pre-built tools and guides that make it easier for developers to build apps for specific platforms, like Android or iOS.

Web APIs:
Web APIs allow websites or apps to get or send data over the internet, like showing weather updates or sending messages.

Library APIs:
These are ready-made functions provided by libraries to save you from writing complex code, like doing math calculations or working with files.

Prompting and Completion:
This is how AI works when you ask it something (prompting), and it gives you a response or generates something based on that input (completion).
